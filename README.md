# CTU-13 Anomaly Detection Project

This project is developed to detect anomalies in network traffic using the CTU-13 dataset. In the project, `Isolation Forest` method is used for anomaly detection.

## Purpose of the Project
This project aims to detect and analyze botnet activities occurring in network traffic. Data processing, visualization and anomaly detection were performed using the CTU-13 dataset.

## Requirements
To run this project you need the following requirements:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scapy
  - sklearn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

**Installing dependencies:**
You can install all dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Installation and Operation
Follow the steps below to run the project code:

Clone the project files: git clone https://github.com/hsila-ui
/ForAssigment.git
cd ctu13_analysis


**Installing dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the code using the sample data: ctu13_analysis.py

About the Data Set
The CTU-13 dataset is a popular dataset used to analyze network-based botnet activities. Some of the traffic in the dataset contains anomalous behavior.

Sample Data File: processed_pcap_data_sample(1-2...-13).csv This file contains a processed sample from the CTU-13 dataset. You can test your code using the sample data.
